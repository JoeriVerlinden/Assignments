    "## Research Question\n",
    "Do survey response rates differ by using different types of incentives?\n",
    "\n",
    "## _Motivation_\n",
    "Surveys are an important method for firms of acquiring information on their customers. This information can for instance be used to improve their current products in such a way that the demands of their customers are more precisely met. In this paper four incentive types are discussed and compared on their effectiveness in increasing survey response rates. These incentive types are categorised as conditional and unconditional incentives, and large uncertain payments and small certain payments. Since it has been documented that offering a non-monetary incentive in the first place increases response rates [(Willimack et al. 1995)](http://poq.oxfordjournals.org/content/59/1/78.short), a group receiving no incentives is excluded in this paper. A first look at existing literature on the incentive types shows that according to an experiment by [Castiglioni, Pforr & Krieger (2008)](https://ojs.ub.uni-konstanz.de/srm/article/view/599/2137) response rates in panel data are higher when unconditional incentives are used compared to incentives that are conditional on the respondent filling in the survey first. On a side note, [Singer et al (1999)](http://www.jos.nu/Articles/article.asp) found that monetary incentives are more effective than non-monetary incentives in increasing response rates, which is also discussed following our results. However, on the trade-off between large uncertain and small certain payments there is little literature to be found. Therefore this paper discusses our experiment, where we investigate the four different incentive types and their effect on response rates and the amount of effort exerted in filling in a survey. It is often important to know the level of effort exerted by the respondents because if a firm is using open-questions for example more effort will most likely increase the value of an answer. Since it is often conventional to survey respondents only once, our experiment compares conditional and unconditional incentive types over a set of independent subjects rather than using a panel as in the experiment of Castiglioni et al.   \n",
    "\n",
    "## _Method_\n",
    "Our experiment was conducted in the form of a randomized controlled field experiment aiming to discover if an unconditional incentive is better than a conditional one and if a small certain payment is better than a large uncertain payment for increasing response rates and effort levels. Each respondent was only asked once such that four independent treatment groups are formed. We constructed a questionnaire consisting of questions about the opinions of certain facilities of the University of Tilburg, which was purposely entirely unrelated to the purpose of the experiment as to prevent it from affecting the outcomes. The level of effort was measured by the amount of words respondents used in answering all open questions. To eliminate selection bias all our respondents were students at computers in the library of Tilburg University. Furthermore the same interviewer was used for all four groups and all respondents of all groups were asked at the same time of day in the same day.\n",
    "\n",
    "As already noted we use four different independent groups in our experiment. Group A represented the small certain payment group where we asked respondents if they wanted to fill in our survey for 50 eurocents. Group B represented the large uncertain payment group where we asked the respondents if they wanted to fill in the survey for a small chance (2,5%) at winning 20 euro's, equalling in expected value the 50 cents. Group C represented the conditional incentive group as we asked the respondents if they wanted to fill in our survey for a chocolate letter. Group D represented the unconditional group who were asked if they wanted a chocolate letter and only afterwards, regardless of their answer, were asked if they wanted to fill in our survey. \n"

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "When comparing the conditional group with the unconditional group we found, through a Fisher Exact Test a significant p-value of 0.048. This means that an unconditional incentive leads to a higher response rate than a conditional incentive when respondents are only asked once. Moreover we found that even if people did not want to have the 50 eurocents they still wanted to fill in the survey. This could be explained by the so called theory of positive reciprocity [(Gneezy & Rey-Biel 2014)](http://pareto.uab.es/prey/jeea.12062.pdf). Respondents of the conditional group exerted more effort than the respondents in the unconditional group in our experiment. However our experiment is conducted on respondents that were only questioned once instead of being used as a panel. When firms are willing to inform or obtain information from customers or citizens multiple times the outcomes could be different. [Caustiglioni & Pforr (2008)](https://ojs.ub.uni-konstanz.de/srm/article/view/599/2137) found that conditional incentives are more effective in increasing response rates than unconditional incentives in panel data. So in the end it would be optimal for firms to use conditional incentives when they use surveys based on panel data and unconditional incentives when they use each respondent only once. \n",
    "\n",
    "When comparing the small certain payments with the large uncertain payments we found no statistically significantly difference in response rates. This could be explained by the fact that our incentives are very small and that people are not affected in a significant way. However we do find a difference in response rates for women. This can be explained by the fact that women are more risk averse [(Dohmen et al 2005)](http://ftp.iza.org/dp1730.pdf). Moreover we did not find evidence that people overestimate small chances. This means that offering respondents a small chance of getting an incentive does not seem very effective. We recommend that firms should use small certain payments instead of large uncertain payments because people tend to be more risk-averse. However this will depend on the chance at the uncertain payment because the higher the chance the lower the risk-aversion will be. \n",
    "\n",
    "From the literature we saw, as earlier noted in the main assumptions, that offering an incentive is always better than not offering an incentive and that offering a monetary incentive is more effective than offering a non-monetary incentive [(Singer et al 1999)](http://www.jos.nu/Articles/article.asp). In our experiment we did not find a significant difference between a monetary incentive and a non-monetary incentive but we would recommend firms to use monetary incentives based on the literature we found. We expect our lack of evidence for this to stem from the small size of our incentives. Furthermore we expect that the higher the reward the higher the response rate is, since there is a linear relationship between these two [(Yu & Cooper 1983)](http://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/3151410.pdf).   \n",
    "\n",
    "A first limitation of our experiment, however, is that it is conducted on respondents that were only questioned once and not (also) as panel data. However their is sufficient literature using panel data on the  comparison between conditional incentives and unconditional incentives. Unfortunately this is not the case for the small certain payment and large uncertain payment comparison. Therefore there is more literature needed because results could be different for panel data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Secondly the value of our incentives are low so results could be different when these are higher. According to the literature the higher the value of the incentive the higher the response rate will be. In case of the conditional and unconditional incentive this could mean that the potential increase in response rate in the conditional group outweighs the potential increase in the unconditional group. In the small certain payments and large uncertain payments the difference could potentially increase because the higher the uncertain payment and the higher the certain payments people would choose the 'safe' option more than the 'unsafe option' because of their risk-aversion.\n",
    "\n",
    "Last of all, increasing the number of respondents and including people who are not a student could potentially change the results as the sample would become more representative of the actual population. Running an experiment that both has higher incentive values as well as a more representative sample, could however, bring considerable costs and that is also the main reason we conducted our experiment in the current way."
